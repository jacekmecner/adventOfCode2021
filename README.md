# Advent Of Code 2021
https://adventofcode.com/

Hello everyone,

This is my first public repository and first Advent of Code event I'm participating in.

I choose to write it in C++ to practice for my Programming Lecture I'm currently taking.
This is also the language I'm mostly focused on right now, not only for my studies.
My goal for this year's competition is just to master the basics.

Please, feel free to comment and use the code. I'd be more than happy to get some feedback.
